  <h1>tiny-rens ðŸš€</h1>
  <p>Blazingly slow "DNS server" without cache</p>
</div>

## How it's works?

Just forward packages over HTTPS (DoH) without
caching or etc.
Good if `systemd-resolved` is is not available
in your country.

By the way, "tiny" prefixes are usually shit
version of normal programs (tcc for example),
but in this case it better than rens. Anyway,
please use `netcat -u -l -p 53 -c 'curl ...'`
instead of this slow shit (written on cURL lol).

## Building

Building requires `libcurl` and ssl shit installed,
also c compiler and make. IQ that great that 18 is
optional but recommended.

```console
$ make
```

TIP: if you need edit config, just copy `default-config.mk`
to `config.mk`.

## Usage

```console
$ bin/rens -h
rens: src/main.c:47: int main(): Assertion `rp != 0' failed.
Aborted
```

Woops. Real help message:

```console
$ bin/tiny-rens -h
Usage: bin/tiny-rens [port | -] [hostname | -] [dnsserver]
       bin/tiny-rens [--help | -h]
Default: port=53 hostname=127.0.0.51
         dnsserver=1.1.1.1
```

Basic usage is testing it, because `tiny-rens` too slow
to use it as real dns server. To start `tiny-rens` on
port 5353 on localhost do: `tiny-rens 5353 localhost`.
Also `-` can be used as default param. To start `tiny-rens`
in default port on localhost do `tiny-rens - localhost`.

## Perfomance

```console
$ drill @127.0.0.1 -p 4444 google.com | tail -n4
;; Query time: 262 msec
;; SERVER: 127.0.0.1
;; WHEN: Sun Nov 27 03:43:12 2022
;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 44
$ drill @1.1.1.1 google.com | tail -n4
;; Query time: 50 msec
;; SERVER: 1.1.1.1
;; WHEN: Sun Nov 27 03:44:16 2022
;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 44
```

But I live in beautiful country, where unsecure DNS
packages can be modified due political reasons...

## To-Do

* Minor bug fixes

Thats final version of `tiny-rens`. Without cache.
Without normal perfomance.
